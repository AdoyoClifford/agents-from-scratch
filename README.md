# 🤖 AI Agents From Scratch

This repository contains my work on building intelligent AI agents from the ground up, inspired by the [Frontend Masters workshop](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/build-ai-agent/).

## 📚 Resources

- Original workshop by Scott Moss on [Frontend Masters](https://frontendmasters.com/workshops/build-ai-agent/)
- Workshop [course notes](https://clumsy-humor-894.notion.site/Agent-from-scratch-13554fed51a380749554c44aa8989406?pvs=4)

## 🚀 What I'm Building

In this project, I'm developing AI agents that can:

- Process and understand natural language instructions
- Execute complex tasks autonomously
- Interface with external APIs and data sources
- Learn and improve based on feedback
- Solve domain-specific problems efficiently

## 🛠️ Setup Instructions

This repo requires **Node.js version 20+** or **bun v1.0.20**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AdoyoClifford/agents-from-scratch.git
cd agents-from-scratch
npm install # or bun install
```

To run the project:

```bash
npm start
# or
bun run index.ts
```

## 🔑 OpenAI API Key

Create an [API Key from OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/api-keys) and save it in a `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY'
```

## 🧠 Agent Architecture

The agents in this repository are built using:

- Large Language Models (LLMs) for natural language understanding
- Function calling for tool use
- Memory systems for contextual awareness
- Planning mechanisms for complex task execution

## 🔄 Project Structure

- `/src` - Core agent implementation
- `/tools` - Custom tools the agent can use
- `/memory` - Agent memory implementation
- `/examples` - Example use cases

## 📝 My Learning Journey

This project is part of my ongoing learning in AI agent development. I'm focusing on:

1. Understanding the fundamentals of LLM-based agents
2. Building robust and reliable agent architectures
3. Creating specialized agents for specific domains
4. Enhancing agent capabilities through better tool integration

## 🤝 Contributions

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome! Feel free to check the [issues page](https://github.com/AdoyoClifford/agents-from-scratch/issues).

## 📌 Next Steps

- [ ] Implement better memory systems
- [ ] Add more domain-specific tools
- [ ] Improve agent reasoning capabilities
- [ ] Create demo applications showcasing agent abilities

## 📄 License

This project is based on the original workshop by Scott Moss and follows its licensing.
